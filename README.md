# Bear Writer

This repository now contains both the React Native code and a web-based markdown editor.

- `src/` – React Native components, contexts and screens.
- `src/web/` – React web editor based on Tiptap.
- `web/` – configuration for the web project (Vite, TypeScript, etc.).

The web editor UI shares the theme colors from the React Native app for a consistent look and feel.
